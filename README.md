# [Outer Wilds Mods](https://outerwildsmods.com/)

Simple page for aggregating info related to mods for the game Outer Wilds. Built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

The mod pages in this website are automatically generated from the [Outer Wilds Mod Database](https://github.com/Raicuparta/ow-mod-db). The main content of each mod page (for example, [outerwildsmods.com/mods/nomaivr](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/nomaivr/)) is taken from that mod's `README.md` (from the default branch).
