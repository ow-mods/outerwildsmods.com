			Welcome to the 3rd Outer Wilds Mod Jam! In this jam, you have 9 days to create a <strong
				>story mod</strong
			>
			for
			<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/" class="link">Outer Wilds</a>,
			following the theme given below.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unlike previous mod jams, this one will have a very specific restriction: You must use New
			Horizons to create <strong>ONE</strong> planet where your story mod will take place. However
			this isn‚Äôt an NH-only jam; You are encouraged to use custom code to add new gameplay mechanics
			to your planet! Read the
			<a class="link" href="https://owml.outerwildsmods.com/">OWML</a>
			docs to learn how to create your mod, and read the
			<a class="link" href="https://nh.outerwildsmods.com/">New Horizons</a> docs to create your planet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lastly, all mods will be set in the <strong>same solar system</strong>. To achieve this, they
			must all depend on the
			<a class="link" href="https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/modjam3/">Jam 3 base mod</a>.

		{/if}

			You decide how to interpret the theme. Make sure you read the <a class="link" href="#rules"
				>rules</a
			>
			and the <a class="link" href="#judging-criteria">judging criteria</a>. Remember that if your
			entry does not implement the theme your entry cannot be considered for judging.

		<p>
			‚ùî Your mod must depend on the <a class="link" href="https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/modjam3/"
				>Jam 3 base mod</a
			> for compatibility. While this will handle the most obvious issues, you should keep compatibility
			in mind when implementing your mods features. For example, you cannot change the length of the
			time loop.
		</p>
		<p>
			ü™ê <strong
				>Your mod must use New Horizons to create one planet which will be the setting for your mod.</strong
			>
			You can use multiple NH configs to create things like hidden dimensions, man-made satellites in
			orbit, or quantum states, so long as the mod is centered around your one planet.
			<u>If unsure about what counts as another planet, ask a jam organizer!</u>
		</p>
		<p>
			üõ§Ô∏è <strong>Your mod can only have utility mods as dependencies.</strong> For example - Slate‚Äôs
			Shipyard, VanillaFix, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			‚è±Ô∏è <strong>
				There must be at least one release uploaded to GitHub within the jam deadline.
			</strong>
			You can make as many releases as you want, but releases made outside the deadline won't be considered.
			<u>Do not overwrite releases, as this will change the upload date of that release.</u>
		</p>
		<p>
			üôã <strong>You can only contribute to one submission.</strong> You can't submit multiple mods,
			or submit one mod solo and one in a team, or participate in multiple teams.
		</p>
		<p>
			üëÆ All submissions must follow the <a
				class="link"
				href="https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/fan-content-policy.html"
				>Mobius Digital Fan Content Policy</a
			>.
		</p>
		<p>
			üõ†Ô∏è <strong>You can use any assets you have a license to use.</strong> Besides using assets already
			available in the game, you're allowed to use assets you find (models, textures, sounds, etc), but
			you must be careful to understand and follow their licenses, just like you would in any open source
			project. And of course, these assets must also follow the digital content policy mentioned above.
		</p>
	</PageSection>
	<PageSection title="Judging Criteria" id="judging-criteria" isNarrow>
		<p>
			After the jam deadline has ended, we will play each submission and review them based on the
			following criteria:
		</p>
		<p>üí≠ How well does it follow the theme?</p>
		<p>
			üíÖ How polished is it? We will value quality over quantity. One highly polished feature is
			better than 20 unrelated mechanics, and one highly polished location is better than 20 empty
			locations.
		</p>
		<p>
			üë§ Overall opinion. The judges are (allegedly) people, so the review process will be mostly
			driven by personal opinion. The judging criteria are guidelines we&#39;ll use while reviewing
			the submissions, they&#39;re not strict rules or values to be fed into a formula.
		</p>
		<p>
			‚ùî Since all mods will add planets to the same star system, your mod should work with all other
			entries enabled!
		</p>
		<p>These guidelines can change depending on how the jam is going.</p>
	</PageSection>
	<PageSection title="How to participate" id="how-to-participate" isNarrow>
		<p class="bg-darker p-2 rounded">
			<strong>TL;DR</strong>: Upload a mod during the jam period, and give it the <code>jam</code> tag
			when submitting to the mod database.
		</p>
		<p>
			To participate, you will need to submit a mod to the Outer Wilds mod database. <a
				class="link"
				href="https://owml.outerwildsmods.com/guides/getting_started.html"
			>
				Read the OWML docs to learn how to make your mod
			</a>. If you are using New Horizons,
			<a class="link" href="https://nh.outerwildsmods.com/tutorials/getting_started.html"
				>read the New Horizon docs to learn how to make your addon</a
			>.
		</p>
		<h3>Upload a release within the deadline</h3>
		<img
			alt="A GitHub release asset must be uploaded before the deadline"
			src="/images/jam-deadline.webp"
		/>
		<p>
			You must upload a release of your mod within the jam deadline. It's OK if you submit the mod
			to the database after the deadline is over, as long as a valid release was uploaded within the
			deadline.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're using the template package the getting started guide has, you can create releases
			easily by following <a
				href="https://owml.outerwildsmods.com/guides/publishing.html"
				class="link">the publishing your mod section of the docs</a
			>.
		</p>
		<p>
			‚ö†Ô∏è <u>Be careful not to overwrite releases</u>, as this would change the upload date. Always
			upload new releases separately.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you upload new releases to your jam mod after the deadline has passed, those releases will
			be ignored. The most recent release that was uploaded within the deadline will be your
			submission.
		</p>
		<h3>Use the <code>jam</code> tag when submitting to the mod database</h3>
		<img
			alt="The mod must have the jam tag along with any other relevant tags when submitted to the database"
			src="/images/jam-tag.webp"
			width={400}
		/>
		<p>
			When you submit your mod to the database, you will need to include the <code>jam</code> tag, together
			with any other tags that make sense for your mod.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong
				>Another submission requirement will be explained once the theme is announced, check back
				then!</strong

	<PageSection title="Teams" id="teams" isNarrow>
		<p>
			You are allowed to form teams as you wish. But we'd prefer for teams to be on the smaller size
			(2-3 people), because otherwise we might not have enough submissions to make the jam
			interesting.
		</p>
		<p>
			Prize rewards will be split equally among all team members, no exceptions. That means you will
			get half the prize if you're on a two person team.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're looking for a team, <a class="link" href="#talk">join our Discord</a> and ask around
			there.

	<PageSection title="Talk to us" id="talk" isNarrow>
		<p>
			Join our Discord server if you have more questions, or just wanna discuss anything related to
			the jam, modding, etc. We have a <code>#jam-chat</code> channel specifically for this. Also
			make sure to go to <code>Channels & Roles</code> at the top of the server and get the Jam role,
			so you can be notified of jam updates.
