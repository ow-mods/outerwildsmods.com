		<p>
			Welcome to the <strong>New Horizons Jam</strong>! In this jam, you'll have one week to create
			custom content for
			<a class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/">
				Outer Wilds
			</a>, following a theme that will be revealed once the jam starts.
		</p>
		<p>
			To add custom content to Outer Wilds, you will use <a class="link" href="/mods/newhorizons"
				>New Horizons</a
			>. You can decide what kind of content you wanna create. You can stick to the original Outer
			Wilds solar system and just modify some existing planets, or add a few new ones. Or maybe
			you'll create a completely new system with new planets. Or you can go even further by using
			custom models, textures, sounds, dialogue, etc. Or anything in between! The
			<a class="link" href="https://nh.outerwildsmods.com"> New Horizons Docs</a> explain what's possible
			to create using this mod.

		<p class="bg-darker p-2 rounded">
			<strong>TL;DR</strong>: Upload a New Horizons addon with <u>no custom code</u> during the jam
			period, and give it the <code>jam</code> tag when submitting to the mod database.
		</p>
		<p>
			To participate, you will need to submit a New Horizons addon to the Outer Wilds mod database. <a
				class="link"
				href="https://nh.outerwildsmods.com/tutorials/getting_started.html"
			>
				Read the New Horizon docs to learn how to make your addon
			</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Your addon can not use custom code</u>. That means the only dll file in your mod should be
			the <code>NewHorizonsConfig.dll</code> file that's included in the
			<a class="link" href="https://github.com/Outer-Wilds-New-Horizons/nh-addon-template">
				New Horizons Addon Template
			</a>. You can, however, use
			<a class="link" href="https://nh.outerwildsmods.com/tutorials/details.html#asset-bundles">
				asset bundles
			</a> to add custom content to your addon (models, textures, sounds, etc).
		</p>
		<h3>Use these tools to create your content</h3>
		<img alt="" src="/images/jam-edit.webp" />
		<p>
			The <a class="link" href="https://nh.outerwildsmods.com/tutorials/getting_started.html">
				New Horizons Docs
			</a>
			explain in detail how to edit the required JSON files with editors like Visual Studio Code. But
			you can also use the
			<a class="link" href="https://nh.outerwildsmods.com/editor.html">
				New Horizons Config Editor App
			</a>, which gives you a more friendly interface for creating, editing, and managing all of the
			addon files.
		</p>
		<h3>Upload a release within the deadline</h3>
		<img alt="" src="/images/jam-deadline.webp" />
		<p>
			If you're using the
			<a class="link" href="https://github.com/Outer-Wilds-New-Horizons/nh-addon-template">
				New Horizons Addon Template
			</a>
			to create your addon (which you should), it will automatically create new addon releases when you
			bump the version in your <code>manifest.json</code> file, as described in the
			<a class="link" href="https://nh.outerwildsmods.com/tutorials/publishing.html">
				New Horizons Docs
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			You must upload a release of your addon within the jam deadline. It's OK if you submit the mod
			to the database after the deadline is over, as long as a valid release was uploaded within the
			deadline.
		</p>
		<p>
			‚ö†Ô∏è <u>Be careful not to overwrite releases</u>, as this would change the upload date. Always
			upload new releases separately. If you're using the New Horizons template and letting it take
			care of creating releases for you, then you shouldn't need to worry about this.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you upload new releases to your jam mod after the deadline has passed, those releases will
			be ignored. The most recent release that was uploaded within the deadline will be your
			submission.
		</p>
		<h3>Use the <code>jam</code> tag when submitting to the mod database</h3>
		<img alt="" src="/images/jam-tag.webp" width={400} />
		<p>
			When you submit your addon to the database, you will need to include the <code>jam</code> tag,
			together with any other tags that make sense for your addon. Every New Horizons addon
			typically also has the <code>content</code> tag, since they add custom content to the game.
		</p>
	</PageSection>
	<PageSection title="Teams" id="teams" isNarrow>
		<p>
			You are allowed to form teams as you wish. But we'd prefer for teams to be on the smaller size
			(2-3 people), because otherwise we might not have enough submissions to make the jam
			interesting.
		</p>
		<p>
			Prize rewards will be split equally among all team members, no exceptions. That means you will
			get half the prize if you're on a two person team.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're looking for a team, <a class="link" href="#talk"> join our Discord </a> and ask around
			there.
		</p>
	</PageSection>
	<PageSection title="Talk to us" id="talk" isNarrow>
		<p>
			Join our Discord server if you have more questions, or just wanna discuss anything related to
			the jam, modding, etc. We have a <code>#nh-jam</code> channel specifically for this. Also make
			sure to go to the <code>#get-roles</code> channel and get the Jam role, so you can be notified
			of jam updates.
